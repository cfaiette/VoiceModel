# VoiceModel
VoiceModel is a project that makes it easier to develop VoiceXML and Tropo speech applications using ASP.Net MVC 4 and Razor. 

VoiceModel uses the MVVM (Model-View-VoiceModel) design pattern to abstract the voice application to a higher level and 
decouples the voice user interface from the application domain and call flow. VoiceModel also supports Reusable Dialog 
Components (RDC) which allow you to build modules that can be reused across voice applications for increased productivity. 
It also has a built-in easy to use state machine that allow you to easily define your call flow. With VoiceModel you can 
develop your voice application once and deploy it for any VoiceXML compatible IVR or the Tropo Cloud IVR.

applications that are developed using ASP.Net MVC 4, Razor and C#.
